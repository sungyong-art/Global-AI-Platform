# Design System: Course Listing Page
**Project ID:** 10699682603333722118

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere
The design follows a futuristic, high-tech "Urban AI" aesthetic. It utilizes a blueprint-inspired grid system and sleek, dark backgrounds to convey a sense of architectural precision and cutting-edge technology. The mood is professional yet innovative, appealing to modern smart city architects.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles
* **Electric Blue (#1142d4):** Primary brand color, used for CTA buttons, active states, and logos.
* **Cyber Navy (#101522):** Background color for dark mode and hero sections, providing deep contrast.
* **Arctic Mist (#f6f6f8):** Page background for light mode, keeping the interface clean and readable.
* **Slate Charcoal (#1e293b):** Primary text color in light mode and secondary card backgrounds.
* **Neon Green (#10b981):** Success indicators and fee waiver labels.

## 3. Typography Rules
* **Font Family:** "Space Grotesk", a geometric sans-serif that embodies a tech and design-forward feel.
* **Headers:** Bold (wght 700), with slightly tight tracking for a premium architectural look.
* **Body:** Clean, legible weights (wght 400-500).

## 4. Component Stylings
* **Buttons:** Generously rounded corners (rounded-xl / 12px), often featuring a soft shadow or "glow" effect when primary.
* **Cards/Containers:** Subtly rounded corners (rounded-xl), with thin borders (border-slate-200/dark:border-slate-800) and whisper-soft diffused shadows for depth.
* **Inputs/Forms:** Large, comfortable height (h-14) with subtle ring focus states.

## 5. Layout Principles
* **Whitespace:** Generous padding and margins to maintain an "airy" architectural feel.
* **Grid:** Standard 12-column grid system with consistent max-widths (max-w-7xl for main content, max-w-xl for mobile-first pages).
* **Navigation:** Sticky top headers with backdrop blur effects for a modern "glassmorphism" touch.
